# Lab Assignment 2: Local and Adversarial Search

The following is an implementation of various local & adversial search algorithms.

## Prerequisites:
* Python >= 3.8
* Pylama ([Linting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting#:~:text=Linting%20highlights%20syntactical%20and%20stylistic,that%20can%20lead%20to%20errors.) Purposes)
* [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/)

## TODO List:
   
- [ ] Fix printing in simulated annealing when finding solutions
- [ ] Add success rates of questions in simulated annealing & hill climbing
- [ ] Start the genetic algorithms

#### Notes
* **Before committing anything, ensure that it is autopep8'd by using the command:** 
```
autopep8 --in-place <filename>
```
